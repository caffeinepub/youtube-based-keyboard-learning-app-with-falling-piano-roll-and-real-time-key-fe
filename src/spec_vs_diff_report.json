  "summary": "Most core frontend features for YouTube URL input + embed, chart import (MIDI/JSON), falling piano roll with transport controls, and keyboard hit/miss feedback appear implemented. However, the onboarding flow requires Internet Identity login before name entry (adds an extra required step vs REQ-1), backend “persistence” is implemented as an in-memory Map (not durable across upgrades/restarts) and is gated by an unrequested authorization system, and the required image assets are not present in the diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On first app load (new session), the only required user input is a name field and a continue/start button, then go directly to practice without other steps.",
      "reason": "The app shows a login screen (Internet Identity) before presenting the name field; this adds an additional required step beyond entering a name.",
